# My memories
It's my biggest front-end project and it took me a lot to build it. I've learned many things while developing. Just wanna show every important aspect, so I'll use a list for this sake:
- Each page was designed by myself, so it also part of my design portfolio.
- NO, NO, NO DEPENDENCIES USED. Each thing was written by myself on PURE Javascript. No frameworks, no JQuery.
- I admit that I've done some serious mistakes which I understood only at the end, they taught me a lot but also made further development useless because refactoring would be taken long.

Mistakes:
- I haven't used any class naming standard. As a result, I got tons of classes with different not related names. Also I messed style classes with js(functional) classes. That has spoiled template flexibility.
- I haven't use NPM to control dependencies and to easily install them. Despite, I was writing on pure JS without dependencies, some dev-dependencies could really help me.
- I haven't used GULP which I consider now to be essential to manage such a big project.
- I haven't used SASS which could provide me wider functionality that would definitely improve things around.
- I've chosen the wrong units. That caused the project to be none responsive on large screens. And also, I suffered a lot from making multiple media queries.
- I haven't used any auto-doc generator for JS to make my code more understandable and standardized.
- My JS code was functional chaos not following any architectural principles.

As you can see, I've been wrong on quite many points. And I suppose that some of my mistakes may be still undetected.

But, you know, one who never mistakes don't do anything, so I consider this natural. As I became aware of what I've been doing wrong I found cures for that and now my current projects are much more quality.

You know, the development lasted for almost 5 months and I've done a lot of research during it because many things weren't clear for me at that time.

I am especially proud of:
- Slider which I developed on JS
- Challenges calculator
- "About me" article

That's the brief description of what was going on in my life at the beginning of 2018. Truly unforgettable.
